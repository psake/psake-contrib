Welcome to the psake-contrib project.
=====================================

psake-contrib is a repository for scripts, modules and functions that are useful for running a build with [psake](http://github.com/psake/psake).


## How to get started:

**Step 1:** Download the project zip file 

**Step 2:** CD into the directory where you downloaded the zip 

You will need to "unblock" the zip file before extracting - PowerShell by default does not run files downloaded from the internet.
Just right-click the zip and click on "properties" and click on the "unblock" button.

**Step 3:** Extract the files in the zip

**Step 4:** Use the scripts and modules in your build 

The following is an excellent technet article on how to ["dot source"](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176949.aspx) a script

Type "help about_modules" in PowerShell for help on how to import, load and use modules
